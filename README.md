## Video Classifier

The Video Classifier project is designed to classify videos into predefined categories or labels using machine learning models. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, usage instructions, and examples.

### Features

- **Video Classification**:
  - Utilizes machine learning models to classify videos based on their content.
  - Supports various video formats and resolutions for classification.

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Includes preprocessing steps such as video frame extraction, feature extraction, and data normalization.

- **Model Training and Inference**:
  - Trains machine learning or deep learning models on labeled video datasets.
  - Performs inference on unseen videos to predict their categories.

### Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip`):
  - `opencv-python` for video processing
  - `scikit-learn` or `tensorflow` for machine learning models

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python scikit-learn
```

For deep learning models:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

### Usage

1. **Clone Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anaumsharif/VIDEO-CLASSIFIER.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd video-classifier
   ```

3. **Prepare Dataset**:
   - Organize your video dataset into folders representing different categories (e.g., sports, music, news).

4. **Preprocess Data**:
   - Use scripts to extract video frames, preprocess features, and prepare data for training.

5. **Train Model**:
   - Train a machine learning or deep learning model using the preprocessed video data.

6. **Run Video Classification**:
   - Use the trained model to classify new videos based on their content.

### Scripts Overview

- **`preprocess.py`**:
  - Script for preprocessing video data, including frame extraction and feature engineering.

- **`train_model.py`**:
  - Script for training a machine learning or deep learning model using preprocessed video features.

- **`classify_video.py`**:
  - Script for classifying new videos using the trained model.

### Examples

#### 1. Preprocessing Video Data

```bash
python preprocess.py --input_dir dataset/videos --output_dir dataset/processed_data
```

#### 2. Training a Model

```bash
python train_model.py --input_dir dataset/processed_data --model_type svm --output_model model.pkl
```

#### 3. Classifying a New Video

```bash
python classify_video.py --input_video test_video.mp4 --model_path model.pkl
```
